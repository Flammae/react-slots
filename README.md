> `react-slots` empowers you to prioritize composability in your component APIs.

The core of `react-slots` is the slot pattern. It's designed to provide all the
features you'd find in Vue and Svelte's slot implementations while keeping
things familiar for React developers. This slot pattern, complemented by **great
type inference features** and an **intuitive API for manipulating nodes**,
allows you to design highly composable components with previously unimagined
patterns in React.

## Examples

| The code samples below represent actual implementations. No need to define external state or event handlers for these components to function. |
