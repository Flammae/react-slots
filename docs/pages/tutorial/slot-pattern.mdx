# The Slot Pattern

The slot pattern allows you to divide parent-provided content and tell a
component where to render each "part". In a typical React component, this is
achieved using 'render props'. Components receive different parts of content as
props and render each one in their specified slots.

For instance your typical `Button` component might accept `children`,
`leftIcon`, and `rightIcon` props, and if provided, render them in their
pre-determined places. With `react-slots`, you no longer need specific props to
define slot content; everything is managed through `children`.

## Writing Your First Slotted Component

To begin using slots, you'll employ the `useSlot` hook. It only requires the
`children` argument and returns the `slot` object. The keys in the slot object
represent the names of the slots intended for use within the component.

Let's implement `Button` component using `react-slots`:

```jsx
import { useSlot } from "@beqa/react-slots";

function Button({ children, onClick }) {
  const { slot } = useSlot(children);

  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      <slot.leftIcon />
      <span>
        <slot.default />
      </span>
      <slot.rightIcon />
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Using Slotted Components

When passing children to this component, you need a way to designate which
elements are for the `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` slots. You achieve this by
adding a `slot-name` attribute to any element or component passed to the
`Button` as children (note: elements marked with `slot-name` must be direct
children of the `Button`). **The `default` slot is special, because any
top-level node lacking a `slot-name` attribute automatically lands in the
`default` slot.**

Let's create a `[Add +]` button using this component:

```jsx
import Button from "./Button.jsx";

function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      Add item to My collection?
      <Button>
        Add <span slot-name="rightIcon">+</span>
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Rendered HTML from this component will look like this:

```html
<div>
  <button>
    <span>Add</span>
    <span>+</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

In a real-world app, the `rightIcon` would likely involve an `Icon` component
instead of a simple span. Note that `leftIcon` won't render anything because it
wasn't specified by the parent.

## TL;DR

- The `useSlot` hook converts component children into slottable content.
- Keys in the `slot` object (returned from `useSlot`) represent slot names and
  can be placed anywhere within the component.
- A Parent can designate elements for each slot by adding a `slot-name`
  attribute.
- The `slot-name` attribute can only be applied to elements and components that
  are direct children of slotted components (doesn't work on nested elements).
- Nodes without a `slot-name` attribute automatically go into the `default`
  slot.
