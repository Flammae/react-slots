# Slot Elements and `hasSlot` object

Slot elements offer some convenient built-in functionality that makes them more
appealing than typical "render props." In this section, we'll explore the
highlights, but remember that the true power of slot elements is buried deeper
down in the documentation.

## Specifying Fallback Content:

Sometimes, you want to render something in a slot even if the parent doesn't
provide specific content. To achieve this, **simply include your fallback
content as children of the slot element.** For example, the `listIcon` slot for
the `BulletList` component might render `ðŸ‘‰` as a fallback if the parent doesn't
specify a `listIcon`.

```jsx filename="BulletList.jsx"
<slot.listIcon>ðŸ‘‰</slot.listIcon>
```

## The `hasSlot` Object

The `hasSlot` object has this type definition:
`type hasSlot = {[slotName: string]: true | undefined}{:ts}`. It's an object
with keys representing slot names specified by the parent. You can use it to
style or structure the UI based on whether the parent provided content for a
particular slot. You can access `hasSlot` by destructuring the `useSlot` return
value. **For example, the `title` slot for the `Card` component might render a
horizontal line after the card title if the title is provided:**

```jsx filename="Card.jsx"
const {slot, hasSlot} = useSlot();
...
<slot.title />
{hasSlot.title && <hr />}
```

## Passing State Up to a Parent

If you want a parent to access an internal state just specify it on the slot
element and parent will receive it. The following `ToggleButton` component keeps
track of the `isToggled` state and passes it up to the parent so that the parent
can change the text on the button based on whether the button is toggled or not.
As a fallback, it renders "Enabled" and "Disabled" if the parent doesn't provide
custom text.

```jsx
function ToggleButton({ children }) {
  const { slot } = useSlot(children);
  const [isToggled, setIsToggled] = useState(false);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => setIsToggled(!isToggled)}>
      <slot.default isToggled={isToggled}>
        {isToggled ? "Enabled" : "Disabled"}
      </slot.default>
    </button>
  );
}
```

  We'll see how to access the `isToggled` state from the parent in the
  [templates](/tutorial/templates) section.
