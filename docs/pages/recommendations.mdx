## Better IDE Experience With Typescript

If you're working with TypeScript, you can take steps to streamline your
development process by moving the `Slot` unions into the template argument of
your component like this:

```tsx
type Props<T> = {
	children: SlotChildren<T>,
	someOtherProp1: string,
	someOtherProp2: number
}

function MyComponent<T extends Slot<{ prop: string }> | Slot<"foo">>(props: Props<T>) {
	return ...
}
```

While this syntax may seem a bit more substantial, it offers the advantage of
allowing you to easily identify the available slots for a component by hovering
over its name. This means you won't need to navigate through the file to see
which slots are supported.

## Untyped Templates and `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`

In TypeScript, it's not possible to type an object that includes every possible
property, which `template` and `slot` do. This can be frustrating when using
untyped `template` or `slot` in your code, as it may lead to an error like this:

```
'template.default' cannot be used as a JSX component.
Its type 'TemplateComponent<string, any> | undefined' is not a valid JSX element type.
Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'ElementType'.
```

This error will only appear if you have `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` set to `true`
in your `tsconfig` (by default, this rule is off). If you prefer to keep this
rule enabled, you have two alternative options:

1. Always type your `children` with `SlotChildren` and `Slot` and utilize typed
   templates created with `CreateTemplate`.
2. Check if the property exists before accessing it, like this:
   `template.default && <template.default />`. However, please note that this
   check is obsolete because every property on the `template` and `slot` objects
   is always defined.
