# Troubleshooting

## ``Unsupported syntax: `useSlot` or an object holding a nested `useSlot` value used inside ...``

If you encounter this error message after initializing the compile-time plugin
for your project, it likely indicates that the plugin is applied after React
elements have already been transpiled. To resolve this issue, you should adjust
your configuration to ensure that the plugin runs before other syntax
transformations.

This error occurs when useSlot or the return value of useSlot is used in a way
that could potentially mutate slots before they are used. It's important to note
that this is a specific error related to the compile-time plugin.

If you wish to disable the transformation for a specific file where this error
occurs, you can add the following comment at the beginning of the file:

```js
// @disable-transform-react-slots
```

After adding this comment, you should only use the function signature of slots
in that file.

Hey there! Just wanted to drop a link to this cool React library I've been tinkering with for the past year: beqa/react-slots. It's all about that slot pattern magic, inspired by Vue and Svelte, and it's 100% type-safe â€“ just the way we like it. :rocket:

Check it out, and I bet you'll stumble upon some fresh patterns you haven't thought about. Here's a snippet that's maybe my favorite:

```jsx
function Edit({ children, enabled }) {
  const { slot } = useSlot(children);

  return (
    <slot.default>
      <OverrideNode 
	props={(props) => ({
	  contenteditable: (enabled && props["data-editable"]) ? "true" : "false" 
	})}
      >
	<div data-editable>{enabled && "Start editing me"}</div>
			</OverrideNode>
		</slot.default>
	)
}

// Usage
<Edit enabled>
  <div data-editable>You can edit me</div>
  <div>You can't edit me</div>
  Can't edit me either
</Edit>;

// This is also editable because of the fallback content
<Edit enabled /> 
```
