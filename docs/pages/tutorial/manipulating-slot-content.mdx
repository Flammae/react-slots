## Manipulating Slot Content With `OverrideNode`

    If you've read the docs this far, I want to say thank you. 
    I and ChatGPT engineers are very happy you're enjoying our work!

    At this point, it's a good time to take a break, sip some coffee, and perhaps
    play with the examples from the [introduction page](/introduction). The upcoming sections might
    get a bit confusing because they intersect with the knowledge you've gained so
    far.

When you start using `react-slots`, you'll notice a new pattern emerging in your
components. Instead of creating components with a massive list of props that
control every aspect of the component's rendered content, you'll be drawn to
creating components with "holes" meant to be filled with parent-provided
**free-form content** and some logic that binds these holes or slots together.
This is a good thing because it allows for a higher level of composability, and
maintaining small pieces independently is much easier than maintaining giant
components.

Despite its benefits, parent-provided free-form content has a drawback: it's a
black box. It might have any shape, its props, event listeners, or styles, and
all of it is hidden away from you. This makes it challenging to integrate
free-form content into the specific logic of your components.

`OverrideNode` gives you direct access to the parent-provided nodes and exposes
a convenient API to manipulate them right before they get rendered.

You can use `OverrideNode` to:

- Enforce node types.
- Intercept element events and execute side-effects before or after their event
  handlers.
- Add or change element props.
- Add aria attributes for accessibility.
- Change the nodes in any way.

`OverrideNode` is just a React element. It can be included as a direct child of
a slot element. When present, it has the ability to override parent-provided
content for the slot. Additionally, if the slot content is not provided, the
children within `OverrideNode` will act as a fallback content and the override
will apply to them.

<Callout type="info">
  `OverrideNode` always applies to the parent-provided content but only applies
  to the section of the fallback content wrapped by the `OverrideNode`.
</Callout>

Let's take a look at some high-level examples before delving into the API
documentation in the next sections:

```jsx
import { OverrideNode } from "@beqa/react-slots";

// Throw an error if the parent provides any element other than "h1", "h2", "h3".
// The rule doesn't apply to fallback content.
<slot.default>
  <OverrideNode allowedNodes={["h1", "h2", "h3"]} />
  <div>
    <h2>Fallback</h2>
  </div>
</slot.default>;

// Remove any node other than a button from the parent's provided "trigger" slot content.
// If the parent provides a button, intercept its onClick event.
// The rule also applies to fallback content when content, which is <button>Trigger</button>.
<slot.trigger>
  <OverrideNode
    allowedNodes={["button"]}
    enforce="remove"
    props={{ onClick: OverrideNode.chainAfter(() => alert("Button clicked")) }}
  >
    <button>Trigger</button>
  </OverrideNode>
</slot.trigger>;
```
