# Installation

The installation process consists of two parts: installing the **core library**
(around **4kb gzipped** piece of code that runs in your users' browsers and
handles the core logic) and an optional **compile-time plugin** (for transpiling
JSX syntax for your slot elements into regular function invocations).

## Install the Core Library

```bash
npm i @beqa/react-slots
```

## Install the Compile-Time Plugin (Optional)

The `transform-react-slots` plugin is necessary to transform slot elements
returned by `useSlot()` into function invocations, as demonstrated below:

```jsx
// Before transpilation
<slot.default prop1={"foo"} prop2={42}>
  Fallback
</slot.default>;
// After transpilation
slot.default("Fallback", { prop1: "foo", prop2: 42 });
```

To install the compile-time plugin, check which build tool is used in your
project and **follow the specific instructions provided for that tool**. Many
projects use Webpack and Babel, but other projects might utilize different tools
such as Vite, esbuild, or Rollup.

<Callout>
  Note: Installing the compile-time plugin is recommended, but you have the
  option to skip it and start using slots as functions immediately.

Install the core library if you haven't already

```bash
npm i @beqa/react-slots
```

Install `@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots`

```bash
npm i -D @beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots
```

Import and add webpack plugin to the plugins list

```js
const { default: unplugin } = require("@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots");

const nextConfig = {
  webpack(config) {
    // Add this line
    config.plugins.unshift(unplugin.webpack());
    // Don't forget to return config
    return config;
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

  <summary>CRA</summary>

If you have an un-ejected Create React App project and want to keep it that way,
we recommend using Craco. Craco allows you to override Create React App's
configuration without ejecting. You can read about
[how to start using Craco and the risks associated with it](https://craco.js.org/docs/).
If your project is ejected, follow the instructions for configuring
`react-slots` with Babel.

Install the core library if you haven't already

```bash
npm i @beqa/react-slots
```

Install `@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots`

```bash
npm i -D @beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots
```

Add a `craco.config.js` file in the root of your project and include the Webpack
plugin:

```js
const { default: unplugin } = require("@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots");

module.exports = {
  webpack: {
    plugins: { add: [unplugin.webpack()] },
  },
};
```

<summary>Vite</summary>

Install the core library if you haven't already

```bash
npm i @beqa/react-slots
```

Install `@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots`

```bash
npm i -D @beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots
```

Add `unplugin.vite` to your`vite.config.js` before the react plugin:

```js
import unplugin from "@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

export default {
  // Make sure unplugin.vite is specified before react in your plugins list
  plugins: [unplugin.vite(), react()],
};
```

  <summary>esbuild</summary>

Install the core library if you haven't already

```bash
npm i @beqa/react-slots
```

Install `@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots`

```bash
npm i -D @beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots
```

Add `unplugin.esbuild` to your plugins list in your esbuild config

```js
import unplugin from "@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots";

await build({
  plugins: [unplugin.esbuild()],
});
```

  <summary>Rollup</summary>

```

Install `@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots`

```bash
npm i -D @beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots
```

Add the `unplugin.rollup` to your plugins list before syntax transformation
plugins in your `rollup.config.js`:

```js
import unplugin from "@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots";

export default {
	...
	plugins: [
		unplugin.rollup(),
		// ... other plugins
	]
}
```

  <summary>Babel</summary>

Install the core library if you haven't already

```bash
npm i @beqa/react-slots
```

Install `@beqa/babel-plugin-transform-react-slots`

```bash
npm i -D @beqa/babel-plugin-transform-react-slots
```

Add the plugin to your `.babelrc` file.

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@beqa/babel-plugin-transform-react-slots"]
}
```

  <summary>Performance Optimization with Unplugin Options</summary>

This section is only relevant to you if you've been instructed to install
`@beqa/unplugin-transform-react-slots` for your build tool.

```tsx
type Options = {
  include: RegEx;
  exclude: RegEx | RegEx[];
};

const options = {
  include: /\.(tsx)|(jsx)|(js)/,
} satisfies Options;

unplugin.yourBundler(options);
```

`unplugin-transform-react-slots` is designed to be fast at finding and
transforming React slots. By default, it checks every JavaScript (js), JSX
(jsx), and TypeScript (tsx) file in your project, excluding files in the
node_modules directory. However, you can optimize its performance further by
using specific options.

**include Option**

If you have other tools configured in a way that JSX syntax is only used in
certain files, you can provide the include regular expression (RegEx) as an
argument to your plugin. For instance:

```tsx
unplugin.yourBundler({ include: /\.(tsx)|(jsx)/ });
```

With this configuration, the plugin will only check .tsx and .jsx files in your
project, improving performance by skipping unnecessary files.

**exclude Option**

Additionally, you can use the `exclude` option to exclude specific files or
directories from being processed. This can be useful for excluding configuration
files or large files that don't need slot transformation:
