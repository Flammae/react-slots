# Templates

As you might have seen, there's a limitation when assigning elements to slots in
a parent component using the `slot-name` attribute. Even simple content like
strings or numbers needs to be wrapped in an element to use the `slot-name`
attribute.

Template elements offer an alternative way to specify content for slots without
the need for the `slot-name` attribute. They work similarly to slot elements,
where they are objects with keys corresponding to the slot names.

Let's see how to use template elements to provide content to the `Button`
component from one of our earlier examples:

```jsx
import { template } from "@beqa/react-slots";
import { Button } from "./Button.jsx";

function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      Add item to my collection?
      <Button>
        Add
        <template.rightIcon>+</template.rightIcon>
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Accessing Child's Specified Props

Templates can also perform an interesting trick. If the `children` of a template
element is a function, it will be called with the props passed to its
corresponding slot in the child component.

In the [previous section](/tutorial/slot-and-has-slot#the-hasslot-object), we
created the `ToggleButton` component, which passes a dynamic `isToggled` prop up
to its parent. Here's how to access that prop in the parent with a template
element:

```jsx filename="SomeOtherComponent.jsx"
<ToggleButton>
  <template.default>
    {(props) => (props.isToggled ? "On" : "Off")}
  </template.default>
</ToggleButton>
```

Please note that just because a prop was passed to the slot in the child
component doesn't mean you must use a template with a `children` function inside
the parent. If you don't need to use the `isToggled` state in the parent, you
can provide a static value with or without a template. You can even provide
multiple contents for the same slot, some of which may or may not depend on the
`isToggled` state.

```jsx filename="SomeOtherComponent.jsx"
<ToggleButton>
  <template.default>The toggle is: </template.default>
  <template.default>
    {(props) => (props.isToggled ? "On." : "Off.")}
  </template.default>
  But I'm always on
</ToggleButton>
```

<Callout type="info">
  When dealing with `default` slots, there's no need to wrap the function in a
  `template.default` element to access the props passed to the corresponding
  slot. Regular functions within the `children` are also executed with the props
  passed to a `default` slot.
</Callout>

## TL;DR

- Template elements offer an alternative way to specify slot content without
  using the `slot-name` attribute.
- They work similarly to slot elements, with keys corresponding to slot names.
- You can access child component specified slots within templates.
- Using templates, you can provide both static and dynamic content for the same
  slot.
