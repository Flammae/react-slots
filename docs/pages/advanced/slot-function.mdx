# Slot Function

Slot elements are essentially functions and are transformed back into functions
by the `transform-react-slots` plugin during build time. Whether you've chosen
to enable the build-time plugin or not, you can always use slots as functions.

You can provide fallback content to slot functions using the first argument and
props with the second argument. Here are some examples showing slot elements and
their equivalent slot functions:

```jsx
<slot.default />;
// Is equivalent to:
slot.default();

<slot.foo>Fallback</slot.foo>;
// Is equivalent to:
slot.foo("Fallback");

<slot.foo prop1={"foo"} prop2={42} {...spreadProps} />;
// Is equivalent to:
slot.foo(null, { prop1: "foo", prop2: 42, ...spreadProps });

<slot.bar prop={42}>
  <OverrideNode>Fallback 1</OverrideNode>
  Fallback 2
</slot.bar>;
// Is equivalent to:
slot.bar([<OverrideNode>Fallback 1</OverrideNode>, "Fallback 2"], { prop: 42 });

<slot.default prop="foo" key={1}>
  Fallback
</slot.default>;
// Is equivalent to:
slot.default("Fallback", { prop: "foo", key: 1 });
// It is also equivalent to:
slot.default("Fallback", { prop: "foo" }, 1);
```
